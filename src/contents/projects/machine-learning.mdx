## What this is

I have 2 machine learning reports in my Github, so I put both of them here. These were my assignments
for my Machine Learning class in 2020.

### 1. YouTube Video Classifier

[source code](https://github.com/bte234/YouTubeVideoClassifier)

This project's goal is to predict what category a YouTube video belongs to based on its description.
I used 5 different classifier models (K-Nearest Neighbor, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree,
Random Forest and Support Vector Machine) and compared them together to see which one has the best
accuracy.

### 2. Waste Classifier

[source code](https://github.com/bte234/WasteClassifier)

In this project, I aimed to classify different type of waste (organic/recyclable) from the dataset.
Unlike the previous project, this project uses images as input, so my approach is a bit different
from the previous one. I still start with a simpler approach with K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), simply
flattening the images into arrays to use as inputs, but I also used Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and compared the results.

Compared to the first project, I also have trained the models with different variables (such as different
number of neighbors for KNN), and show how the results vary.

## Why it's made

I have been interested in Machine Learning for a long while before taking the ML class, but I never was
really able to learnt it. My team leaders from both of my previous internships (Fablab Hanoi and Vinple)
have asked me to learnt Machine Learning before, but I never got far in either time. Hence, when I saw
that there was a free elective course about Machine Learning, I registered for it as fast as I could.

Even though Machine Learning was not related to my work interest and I never intended to go deeper with it,
I still had a lot of fun learning about the topic and making the projects.
