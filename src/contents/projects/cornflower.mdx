## What this is

Cornflower allows the server admins to create and manage clubs for their members.
Members can join any club that they are interested in, or leave a club they are in easily.
Server admins can also assign club presidents who can manage members of their own club.

Cornflower is designed to be as simple as possible and does not use any external database for storage.
Instead, it uses Discord roles to manage club members.

Cornflower used to be hosted in repl.it, but as I do not use it anymore, it now only exists as a repository.

## Why it's made

A server owner friend of mine was expressing interests on a club feature as described for their server,
as the number of channels on the server keeps increasing, and there are also more channels about topics
that the members are interested in, but works better as an opt-in channel rather than a main one. They also
want to be able to assign club presidents to manage the club channels so as to reduce work on the server admins,
but also do not necessarily trust them enough to give them admin permissions. As Discord's base features could not
solve these issues, I collaborated with [another friend of mine](https://github.com/Knamer95) make a bot that can do so.

The server owner did not end up needing the feature since there were less new topics that's worth making a channel for,
and since Discord introduced threads, which also helps with managing the channels. Still, I was able to learn quite a bit
with this experience
