## What this is

Code4Fun is the first IT club in Fairleigh Dickinson University, Vancouver campus.
Our goal is to help IT students in the school to study better, as well as to find the joy in programming.

This website is a small project to help our club members have a better understanding of web development.
For many of our club members, including myself, this was the first website we've ever built.
